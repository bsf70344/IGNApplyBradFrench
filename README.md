#   *IMPORTANT* - I was unable to attach a uiwebview alongside the articles and videos, as I was having difficulty with the uiscrollview stealing all of the touches when I was trying to click an article. I apologize for the inconvenience.

#   I tried to create an almost exact replica of Qwirkle; it was difficult to get all the pieces to look exactly alike using just the Bezier Paths, so I apologize.

#   Rules: 
#          1) You are always going to go first
#          2) You always have to lay down a tile for your first move
#          3) If you complete a row or column, you get an additional 6 points.
#          4) Tiles, vertically or horizontally, must be either the same shape or the same color. The row must continue with the same pattern once it is started.
#          5) Once the tiles runs out, whoever has the highest score wins.
#          6) If tiles do not run out, just keep making your turn and press finish when you are done with your turn.
#          7) The board(grid) grows dynamically, so no worry about spacing.
#          8) Also note, the tiles will move within the board. This allows at least 6 spaces on every side from the most external pieces, so the board is never a hinder to playing the game.
#          9) It animated the pieces, so you can just slide around to go look for them.
#          10) To trade out tiles, you can click on the tiles you want to trade, then click change. Changing tiles are colored purple on the border. If you drag any tiles on the board, all tiles are not considered changing and reverted back
#          11) You can undo a move, but it undoes any move you made that given turn. So, all tiles from that turn will be moved back to your hand.
